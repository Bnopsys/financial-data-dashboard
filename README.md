# (WIP) Financial Dashboard Project

The Financial Dashboard Project is a tool that takes my current bank/credit card transactions and analyzes the data so I can make meaningful conclusions from it. For privacy reasons, the data isnt included with the project. <br/> 

> Project Goals: 
> 1. Learn more about Pandas and become more comfortable with it, 
> 2. Create a budget for both myself and Reanne
> 3. Work more with Data Visualization

## Vision
The vision i see with this project is that after building the code i can have it make API calls daily to my banks so that I can monitor bank and credit card transactions. There are apps around that let you manually input expenses like buying a coffee or something but these require dicipline to track all expenes. If i could just pull the data from my bank accounts directly I could open see all of my transactions for multiple accounts and have the code sort charges so that I keep to my budget. 

Also there would be different visuals to help me track my progress. So pie charts, bar graphs and a mix of short and long range charts showing both day by day as well as monthly data to give me information to go off of.


## Pull data
