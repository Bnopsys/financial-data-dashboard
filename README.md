# (WIP) Financial Dashboard Project
#### The Financial Dashboard Project is a tool that takes my current bank/credit card transactions and analyzes the data so I can make meaningful conclusions from it. For privacy reasons, I didn't include my data with the project. I had a few main goals with this project that are: 
1. Learn more about Pandas and become more comfortable with it, 
2. Create a budget for both myself and Reanne
3. Work more with Data Visualization

## Outline for README
### Pandas

### Budget

### Data Visualization
#### Tables

#### Graphs/Charts
